# WD201 Online Marketplace for Local Artisans
## Statement
In today's digital age, local artisans often struggle to reach a wider audience for their unique handmade products.

## Outcome
The expected outcome is a functional and visually appealing online marketplace that connects local artisans with buyers in a user-friendly and secure environment. The application should demonstrate effective use of full-stack development principles, showcasing seamless integration between frontend and backend components. Additionally, provide documentation and instructions for deploying the application to a production environment.
