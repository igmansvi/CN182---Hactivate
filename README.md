# WD201 Online Marketplace for Local Artisans

## Statement

In today's digital age, local artisans often struggle to reach a wider audience for their unique handmade products. This project aims to develop a full-stack web application that serves as an online marketplace for local artisans to showcase and sell their creations while providing a seamless shopping experience for buyers.

## Requirements

1. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization functionalities to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Differentiate between roles such as artisans and buyers, with appropriate access permissions.

2. **Artisan Profiles:** Enable artisans to create and customize their profiles, showcasing their products, artistic style, and background. Provide features for uploading images, writing descriptions, and setting prices for their handmade goods.

3. **Product Listings:** Implement a product listing feature where artisans can add and manage their products, including images, titles, descriptions, categories, and prices. Ensure that products are displayed attractively with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.

4. **Search and Filtering:** Develop search and filtering functionalities to allow buyers to easily discover products based on categories, keywords, price range, and artisan profiles. Implement sorting options to refine search results according to relevance, popularity, or price.

5. **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** Enable buyers to add products to their shopping cart, review cart contents, and proceed to checkout for payment. Implement a secure payment gateway to facilitate online transactions, supporting popular payment methods such as credit/debit cards and digital wallets.

6. **Order Management:** Provide tools for both artisans and buyers to manage orders, including order tracking, shipping status updates, and order history. Implement email notifications to inform users about order confirmations, shipping updates, and order completion.

7. **Community Interaction:** Foster community engagement by implementing features such as product reviews, ratings, and comments. Enable buyers to leave feedback for purchased products and artisans to respond to customer inquiries or feedback.

## Add-ons

1. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the web application is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

2. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the performance of the application to ensure fast loading times and smooth user interactions. Implement caching mechanisms, image optimization techniques, and lazy loading for improved performance.

3. **Social Sharing:** Integrate social media sharing functionalities to allow users to share products they love with their friends and followers on popular social networks.

4. **Localization:** Consider implementing localization features to support multiple languages and currencies, catering to a diverse global audience of artisans and buyers.

## Outcome

The expected outcome is a functional and visually appealing online marketplace that connects local artisans with buyers in a user-friendly and secure environment. The application should demonstrate effective use of full-stack development principles, showcasing seamless integration between frontend and backend components. Additionally, provide documentation and instructions for deploying the application to a production environment.

Note: While the provided requirements outline the core features of the online marketplace, you're encouraged to innovate and add additional features or enhancements to differentiate your solution. Focus on delivering a polished and scalable application that addresses the needs of both artisans and buyers in the local artisan community.
